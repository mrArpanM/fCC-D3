## Objectives

*  My chart should have a title with a corresponding id="title".
*  My chart should have a g element x-axis with a corresponding id="x-axis".
*  My chart should have a g element y-axis with a corresponding id="y-axis".
*  Both axes should contain multiple tick labels, each with a corresponding class="tick".
*  My chart should have a rect element for each data point with a corresponding class="bar" displaying the data.
*  Each bar should have the properties data-date and data-gdp containing date and GDP values.
*  The bar elements' data-date properties should match the order of the provided data.
*  The bar elements' data-gdp properties should match the order of the provided data.
*  Each bar element's height should accurately represent the data's corresponding GDP.
*  The data-date attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the x-axis.
*  The data-gdp attribute and its corresponding bar element should align with the corresponding value on the y-axis.
*  I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.
*  My tooltip should have a data-date property that corresponds to the data-date of the active area.
